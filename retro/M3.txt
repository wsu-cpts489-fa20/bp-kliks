Retrospective Meeting notes:
1.) Milestone 2 Grading: 
- Talked about the different sections
- Retrospective Meeting Summary	
- Testing Link: The links are working correctly, confused why we received such a low score

2.) UPDATES:
Rebecca: Done with issues night of 12/2/2020, so that test issue can get completed on time. Wrapping up a way to add courses tonight.
Dane: Started working on the button issue, but ran into a problem with npm so was not sure if changes were being applied. But, the rest of the issues require other issues to be done.
Marco: Finished the issue just waiting on Dane to see how he renders the table [Blocked by Dane issue]
Osman: Created another issue for the actually saving questions and surveys. Created a PR for issue #38. Transferred issue #30 to Marco Arceo.
Verenice: Reassign issue #37 to marco and Verenice will be doing UI tasks [issue #39]. But, still working on issue #39

3.) Questions/Concerns:
--Initally, instructor were not able to create questions without having serveys, and we did not have a create
survey
--npm issues [pertaining to old version of npm].
--Rolling one of the student issues into Milestone 4 beucase we do not have a student UI.
