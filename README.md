# BP Kliks app
Kliks is a classroom response system implemented by Professor Emeritus Carl Hauser in Python, HTML and CGI (I believe). While the back-end system is solid, anyone who has used the front-end user interface is aware of its limitations. This project aims to reimplement, improve and expand the Kliks environment so that it is more useful and easier to use. The new Kliks will be fully integrated into OSBLE, so it can minimally share OSBLEâ€™s user management system. A number of epics will be defined to address different aspects of Kliks, including the student and instructor interfaces.

**Goal**: To build a usable and useful classroom response/polling/participation app.

Kliks site is located [here](https://kliks.bfapp.org/): https://kliks.bfapp.org/

features for the Kliks application are below:
* Ability to sign in with @wsu.edu email.
* Ability to register with @wsu.edu email.
* Ability to reset password using security question/answer.
* Ability to create different types of questions.
    * Free Response.
    * Multiple Choice.
    * File upload.
* Ability to delete questions.
* Ability to activate questions.
* Ability to stop questions.
* Ability to view responses.
* Ability to remove responses.

**Milestone 3 Changes:**\
The changes that were made in milestone dealt mainly on frontend work. One of the main things that we did was add some UI for the student side of the application.\
Unlike before, now we STUDENTs are able to view the courses that they are taking and the students in that course. On the Instructor side, instructors are now able to\
add courses, view all created courses, create questions, create surveys, and view surveys. We also worked on updating the sideMenu content.\
<!-- Below are tasks that we also added the dashboard pages for the instructor page. In addition, we also added the ability to edit questions, view saved questions and active questions\
and the ability to broadcast questions to students that are online. -->

**Milestone 4 Changes:**
For milestone 4, we worked on creating the student page, making some bug fixes, cleaning up the active Questions page,\
and adding more functionalities to the surveys aspect of the application. For the active questions, an instructor now has the ability to\
deactive and active questions, and view questions that are active and not active. The UI for this is build, but there is logic that still needs to be completed. For SearchSurveys, an\ instructor now can search for surveys, remove surveys, sort surveys based on different sort criterians. For courses, an instructor can now add a student that has an vaid student account.\
In addition, to beiong able to add students, an instructor can edit and remove students from a\ course. The bug fixes that were made were refreshing the courses table, automatically\ refreshing the other tables, and making the ids unique across all objects that are created and\ saved to MonogDB.
